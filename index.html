							<h2>Dusty - ElPaloGames</h2>
						</header>
						<p> Dusty is a narrative and puzzles solving 3D experience where the player will control Dusty, an archeologist who is looking for a lost kingdom. </p>

						<p> I'm working as a gameplay programmer for <a href="https://linktr.ee/el.palo.games" target="_blank">ElPaloGames</a> in Unreal Engine. You can take a look at the trailer of the game! The game will be released soon!</p>

						<p>My role involved various aspects of game development, including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Creating most of the gameplay mechanics such as the pole jump and pole elevator</li>
							<li>Managing the save system and level streaming for the game</li>
							<li>Developing the UI and HUD elements</li>
							<li>QA testing and bug solving</li>
						</ul>

							<h2>Unnamed Project - Yet</h2>
						</header>
						<p> This project will be a shooter-style game with a focus on base stats, a variety of enemies, and a system for modifiers and upgrades. My goal is to create a well-structured game that allows for easy addition and connection of existing and new features.</p>
						<p> Kind of similar to vampire survivors, I wanted to give it my personal feeling. The upgrades you get will only last for a time, so if you're not killing enough enemies youâ€™ll revert to your base stats while facing a swarm of foes. </p>
						<p> There will be a feature that allows you to enhance these upgrades, making them more effective and extending their duration. Take a look at what I expected the game to look like during a playthrough! </p>

							<h2>SuperPanas</h2>
						</header>
						<p> SuperPanas is a local coop game that some classmates and I developed for the GameJam that was hold by U-tad for the Unity subject. It's available on <a href="https://superpanas.itch.io/super-panas" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

						<p>This game was developed within 48 hours during class. I contributed by designing gameplay mechanics, including various platform types and levels, to create a procedural game experience.</p>

							<h2>MapCraft</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I wanted to challenge myself by creating a strategy and resource management game while improving my skills in Unity.
							You can find the game in <a href="https://ounsesa360.itch.io/mapcraft" target="_blank"> itch.io</a>. The game takes around 10-15 minutes to play
						</p>

						<p>I focused on integrating various systems, such as gameplay loot and crafting, with the UI to ensure all information is accurately updated and displayed.</p>

						<p>I've also developped a Unity Tool to make the game design easier when deciding the initial conditions of the game and the map</p>

							<h2>Bomberman Unity</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I recreated Bomberman as a local 2-player game, marking my first steps in learning Unity. Through this project, I learned how to manage entity creation and destruction, as well as how to set up player inputs using Unity's new input system. Here is a video of the final game</p>

							<h2>Bomberman C++</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Before working with game engines, I created a Bomberman clone using C++. This local 2-player game features AI to simulate player opponents. This project was an opportunity to refine my C++ skills in preparation for the upcoming Dusty project.</p>

						<p> Here is a demonstration video with both players as AI.</p>
